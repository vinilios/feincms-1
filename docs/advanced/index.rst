This section is targeted at more advanced users of FeinCMS. It goes into
details which are not relevant for you if you only want to use the
:mod:`~feincms.module.page` module or the media library on your site.

However, if you want to understand the inner workings of the CMS, the
design considerations and how to optimize your code, this section is for you.
